## Overview

A more complicated example of tests written in Gherkin using the GherkinSpec test adapter.  See the [GherkinSpec repository](https://github.com/GivePenny/GherkinSpec) for more information.

This example is intended to demonstrate possible features, as such it may not always show the simplest means to achieve a goal.

## Features demonstrated

* BeforeRun and AfterRun hooks
* Dependency Injection using .NET Core's standard Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection extension.
* Async/await steps causing tests to run in parallel
* Scenarios and Scenario Outlines
